Objective: Text_dialogue_summarization_Flan-T5-base model 

This project gives good understanding on prompt engineering, fine tuning, PEFT techniques with Flan-T5 LLM model.

Below important steps should be followed for normal execution of jupyter code.
1. Run file in kaggle.
2. Select GPU P100(~15.9GB).

Majorly full fine tuning requires ~15GB GPU RAM with least tranining configurations.

Above is cost free code and can be run even with machine having low configurations.
